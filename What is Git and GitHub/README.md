# What is Git and GitHub

## What is Git
Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files. It is used for coordinating work among several people on a project and tracking progress over time.
- It is used for source code management in software development.

*So, what is a version control system?*
A version control system is a system that records all the changes made to a file or set of files, so a specific version may be called later if needed. This helps in collaboration with all team members.

**Now, let's continue with Git:**

- Git benefits both programmers and non-technical users by keeping track of their project files.
- It allows multiple users to work together.
  - Git facilitates collaboration and permits changes made by multiple people to all be merged into a single source.
- Large projects can be handled efficiently.
  - It automatically merges changes so that people or different sources can even work on different parts of the same file and later merge those changes without losing each other's work.

## What is GitHub

- GitHub is a git repository hosting service that provides a web-based graphical interface.
  - GitHub is a service hosted on the web where all the projects are stored; every project on GitHub has its own repository and its unique URL.
- GitHub helps every team member work together on the project from anywhere and makes it easy for them to collaborate.
  - Git provides a graphical interface to store the files and helps team members coordinate on the project from anywhere. GitHub provides several access controls and collaboration features like wikis and basic task management tools for every project.
