# What is Git and GitHub

## What is Git
Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files. It is used for coordinating work among several people on a project and tracking progress over time.
- It is used for source code management in software development.

*So, what is a version control system?*
A version control system is a system that records all the changes made to a file or set of files, so that a specific version may be called later if needed. This helps in collaboration with all team members.

**Now, let's continue with Git:**

- Git benefits both programmers and non-technical users by keeping track of their project files.
- It allows multiple users to work together.
  - Git facilitates collaboration and permits changes made by multiple people to all be merged into a single source.
- Large projects can be handled efficiently.
  - It automatically merges changes so that people or different sources can even work on different parts of the same file and later merge those changes without losing each other's work.

## What is GitHub

- GitHub is a git repository hosting service that provides a web-based graphical interface.
  - GitHub is a service hosted on the web where all the projects are stored; every project on GitHub has its own repository and its unique URL.
- GitHub helps every team member work together on the project from anywhere and makes it easy for them to collaborate.
  - Git provides a graphical interface to store the files and helps team members coordinate the project from anywhere. GitHub provides several access controls and collaboration features like wikis and basic task management tools for every project.

## Why use a version control system

- Mohammed is working on a project. Two days ago, a partial modification was made to the project. Today, Mohammed is reviewing the project and discovers that the modification made by someone else two days ago caused many problems. The problem would have been easy to identify if Mohammed had reviewed the code before the modification. However, Mohammed does not typically work in this manner.

- In the second scenario, Mohammed is working on a graduation project. Just two days before the project is due, his device breaks, causing the entire project to disappear with the device. Mohammed feels very angry in this situation. He must submit the project within two days, but it is now lost. If Mohammed had been regularly saving version backups of his project and uploading them to the server, retrieving the last version he uploaded and completing the project would have been simple. However, Mohammed does not typically work in this manner.

- We have a company with a team consisting of four people, all of whom are working on the same project and contributing to it. You may wonder how they can all work on the same project without encountering any problems. This is where the idea of a version control system comes in.
